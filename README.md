# Euler JS

## Intro
I thought I'd write some Project Euler solutions in JS to help me learn.
https://projecteuler.net/

## The files
Usual web setup: 
* `index.html` **- to run the show**. Simple < div > to list the solutions.
* `euler.js` **- the solutions code**. Each problem has its own solution function (I add new ones to the top for ease of access, so they're in reverse order), there are general helper functions at the end, and there's an array that can be used to select which problems to run. The 'logging' variable sets whether console logging is enabled (this slows down the code massively, of course!). I did this more to explore the relationship between the script and the Dom. I might extend this further to have form inputs on the page to change the contents of the array and switch logging on and off.
* `styles.css` **- just to dress the div up!**

## Some other ideas...
* I might try extending the web page so it displays each js code solution in an expansion panel.
* A button per solution to click that makes it run.
* A copy button, to copy the solution for pasting into the Project Euler problem page.
* Incorporate it all into my half baked github pages site!
